              In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise
              and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he
              had been diligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little
              god—and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly
              insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together
              among the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our
              craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the
              selection of the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo
              purposed befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already
              pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael,
              should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had
              turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship
              myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.

              I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed
              great confidence in the excellence of Yojo’s judgment and
              surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with
              considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps
              meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed
              in his benevolent designs.

              “Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg—that’s who ye are speaking to,
              young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod
              fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs,
              including crew. We are part owners and agents. But as I was going
              to say, if thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest
              ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind
              yourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young
              man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg.”
